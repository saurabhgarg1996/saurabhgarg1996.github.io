Surveyed the literature on state-of-the-art methods in deep learning for the problem of labeling unsegmented data. Explored models based on a combination of RNNs and the CTC objective function, and models based on segmental RNNs. Implemented an end to end speech recognition system using CTC objective function
Studied attention and memory augmented based RNN models for some tasks including machine translation, handwriting synthesis, and speech recognition
