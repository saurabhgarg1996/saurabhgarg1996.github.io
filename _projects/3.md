Proposed an exact MCMC sampling algorithm from MRF models on label images and showed its efficacy for uncertainty estimation in Medical MRI images. Accepted at MICCAI, 2018.
Extended above work to more generic MRF models, including GF and SBM. Submitted a detailed version to MIA Journal which involves more theoretical analysis and validation.
