Worked on designing an approximation algorithm that possesses a high degree of concurrency so that they can be implemented efficiently on shared and distributed memory multiprocessors for a variant of stable fixtures problem.
Implemented the algorithm to analyzed its performance on various graph structures and compared its performance against a collection of algorithms that have been proposed earlier.
