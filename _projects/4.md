Proposed *D-RNNLM*, a novel language modeling approach for code-switched text. Explored techniques to effectively train RNNLM for low-resource scenarios. Accepted as a short paper at EMNLP, 2018.
Formulated a framework for combining two monolingual language models using a probabilistic model. Accepted at Interspeech 2018.
