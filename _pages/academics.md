## Academic Projects

* **From Image Classification to Audio Classification** \| Guide: Prof. Preethi Jyothi,  Autumn 2017
   * Used embeddings from trained image classification architectures (viz. VGG net) to classify the audio
   * Implemented multiscale input representation using dilated convolutions to transfer learned representations from the image classification task to an unrelated task of voice focused audio classification.
* **FCNs for Semantic Segmentation** \| Guide: Prof. Suyash Awate, Spring 2017
  * Explored incorporating conditional random fields into the implementation of the Fully Convolutional Network which uses only convolution and deconvolution layers in order to generate smooth pixel-wise labels for an image
  * Implemented the same in end-to-end fashion by transferring the learned representations of classification networks (viz. VGG net) to the segmentation task
* **Latex Code Generation** \| Guide: Prof. Suyash Awate, Prof. Ajit Rajwade, Autumn 2016
  * Developed a module which generates the latex code for scanned images of printed latex equations
  * Used principles and techniques like adaptive thresholding with mean filtering, Hough transforms for image binarization, skew correction and hu-invariant moments
* **Intelligent Pac-Man Agent** \| Guide: Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan, Spring 2017
  * Built a single and multi-agent intelligent agent which can play Pac-Man utilizing heuristic based Minimax and Expectimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning for tackling multiple ghosts 
  * Performed inference using Particle Filters and Dynamic Bayes Nets for tracking the positions of the ghosts
* **Flappy Bird Learning Agent** \| Guide: Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Spring 2016 
  * Developed an AI agent for the Flappy Bird which outperforms an average human attempt
  * Used Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms which simulated survival based on the principals of mutations, survival of fittest and cross-breeding to update the underlying Neural Network
* **Readers Space** \| Guide: Prof. S. Sudarshan Autumn, 2016 
  * Developed a platform for readers with auto-suggestion feature which uses Page-Rank type algorithm for book suggestion based on correlation between friends profile, mutual interests, and ones own history of literary activities

* **Others**:
  * Link Prediction in Social Graphs: Implemented a state-of-the-art link prediction algorithm in social network
graphs in the SNAP framework.
  * Learning to Run (NIPS 2017): Explored Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients algorithm to synthesize physically and physiologically accurate motion of a human musculoskeletal model
  * C-like Compiler: Developed a compiler for a subset of C grammar which can perform dead code elimination on the intermediate code using live variable Analysis during compilation, for MIPS instruction set using flex and bison C++
  * Multi-Function Elevator Controller: Designed and implemented an elevator controller to handle concurrent request to minimize energy consumption using heuristic elevator scheduling algorithm in VHDL
  * Distributed password cracker: Built a distributed client-server system where client requests a hashed password to the server, and server divides the job dynamically among workers and returns the cracked password back to the client
  * Surveillance Bot: Designed a robot capable of shooting the desired target automatically using Edge Detection techniques and Control loop feedback mechanism on a microcontroller
  * Library Helpmate Bot: Fabricated a bot that can help curators in maintaining book clusters by using onboard book detection and shortest path line following algorithm in embedded C
